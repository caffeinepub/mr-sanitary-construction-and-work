REQ-2 documentation changes are present but the provided diff content is truncated before showing required details (trailing-slash handling and verification steps). REQ-4 backend guidance was updated to mention VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, but the example value format shown conflicts with the frontend’s “full URL with protocol” requirement.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo references VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL but provides an example value without protocol (\"app.yourdomain.com\"), which conflicts with the frontend requirement/documentation that the variable be a full URL with protocol (e.g., https://example.com).",
