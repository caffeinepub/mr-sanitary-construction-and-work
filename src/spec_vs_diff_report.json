  "summary": "Implemented a configurable public site URL via VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL with runtime fallback, and added dynamic canonical/OG URL generation in frontend/index.html plus a new domain configuration doc. However, the diff does not provide evidence of a full frontend audit to remove/replace all hard-coded domain/host references (REQ-2). Also includes some unrequested changes (notably backend domain-change comments and project_state bookkeeping).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Audit the frontend for any hard-coded domain/host references and replace them with relative URLs or the new domain configuration so changing the domain does not require code changes in multiple components.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the new site URL config module and index.html metadata handling, but does not show changes across the broader frontend codebase to remove/replace any existing hard-coded domain/host references. With only Footer.tsx shown (and truncated) and no other component diffs, there isn’t sufficient evidence that an audit/replacement was completed.",
