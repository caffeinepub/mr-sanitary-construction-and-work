// # Change Site Domain for Deployment
//
// To update the deployed site's domain name:
// 1. Open <path-to-deployment-config> (this config is usually in dfx.json).
// 2. Change the value of `<domain-entry>` to your desired domain name (e.g. "app.yourdomain.com").
//
// This is the only place you need to modify for the domain change to take effect.
