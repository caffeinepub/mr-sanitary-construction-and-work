// # Change Site Domain for Deployment
//
// To update the deployed site's domain name:
//
//   - Set the `VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable in the frontend to match your desired domain
//   (e.g., "app.yourdomain.com").
//
// This is the only place you need to modify for the domain change to take effect.
